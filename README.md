# Personal backup for my i3/Sway config.

I ran i3wm inside of XFCE for the longest time, so there was no need for additional programs, as I could simply rely on the XFCE suite.
Still working on some of it. I keep them as concise as I can without unnecesary comments.
Ghostty was compiled from source to attain the latest version (check https://ghostty.org/docs). You will need Zig >0.14. Use `git checkout -b 1.2`
