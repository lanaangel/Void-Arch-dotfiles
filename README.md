# Personal backup for my i3/Sway config.

##### I ran i3wm inside of XFCE for the longest time, so there was no need for additional programs, as I could simply rely on the XFCE suite.
##### Still working on some of it. I will try to make the dotfiles as concisely as I can and root out the unnecesary comments.
##### Ghostty was compiled from source to attain the latest version (check https://ghostty.org/docs). You will need Zig >0.14. 
##### Clone the repo, change directory into it and run `git checkout -b 1.2` then build it with Zig.
